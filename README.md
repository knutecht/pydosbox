# pydosbox
A frontend to the exellent DOSBox emulator.

This file provides information for the pyDosBox frontend.
It is still in alpha stage, although usable.

To use it you need python 3 and pygtk 3.

No installation is necessary. Just execute it and it will pop up!
I haven't test it under windows, so probably it won't run, although 
python and gtk are multi-platform.

If the DosBox application doesn't start, it's possible that the 
executable is not found. Then go to the ~/.pydosbox file and edit
the first option (self.dosboxpath) to reflect the position of the
dosbox executable.

For any comments you are welcomed to contact me.
